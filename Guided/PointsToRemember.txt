 --Break and Return
 The break keyword terminates a loop or switch statement, but the return keyword terminates the current method

--Parameters passed by value and passed by reference
 When an argument is passed to a method, value type variables have their values copied into the method. 
 Each variable has its own copy of the value, so the original variable isn't modified._________
With reference types, the address of the value is passed into the method. 
The variable given to the method references the value at that address, so operations on that 
variable affect the value that is referenced by the other.
